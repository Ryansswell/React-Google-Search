## Description

React Google Book Search:
This app was created to help users to be able to search any book within the Google Books Search. This was a fun project during my coding boot camp and gave me a great appreciation for REACT!

## Usage

Provide any search item to see the examples of books within Google Books.

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

npm install

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

npm start

Your app should now be running on http://localhost:3000. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
